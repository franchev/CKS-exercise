This is a set of instructions, exercises, and demos used to prepare for the CKS certificate offered by the Linux Foundation. You'll also find information regarding cost, exam objectives, duration, etc in this documentation. 

For the exam, you are allowed to have one extra browser tab open, which you can use to refer to the Kubernetes official documentation. I would not advise that you rely heavily on those documentation, because you only have a limitted amount of time to finish the exam.

<h2> Practice_exams folder</h2>

<p> In this folder, you'll find a list of practice exams that contain multiple questions that you can use to prepare for the exam. My advise is to try to time yourself. Set a duration of 2 hours for each practice exam and see how well you do, before you reveal the answers for each question. REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST A PRACTICE EXAM AND MIGHT NOT SHOW UP AT ALL ON THE REAL EXAM.</p>
